sample-002606 the steak fought frankly making [vocalized-noise] sounds that's shattered the silence of the desert 
sample-002611 it was the old man who spoke first 
sample-002612 and you toll had been made by the impact of the product tell 
sample-002613 the caravan began to travel day and night

sample-002673 the knows what old around the ward 
sample-002676 half an hour later his shovel hit something solid

sample-002680 it is i- the boy answered 
sample-002683 i heard a faint movement under my feet 
sample-002686 some do come back 
sample-002688 something bright reflected from his chest was such intensity that the boy was momentarily blinded 
sample-002689 i thought tonight i'd put miss carry there 
sample-002691 but you will love her and she'll return your love 
sample-002693 evidently we're the four so

sample-003104 my key chain is heavy and awkward to carrying my pocket 
sample-003106 and the sand and gravel had been flung [vocalized-noise] in every direction 
sample-003107 the wind began to blow again 
sample-003108 but the boy never took his eye of his new friend 
sample-003111 the old man was probably a gypsy too

sample-003173 i'd know that boys anywhere 
sample-003177 i couldn't stop staring at it 
sample-003180 it was dropping off lakes and rain down in the sand 
sample-003182 scattered group of people were hurrying from the direction of [vocalized-noise] 
sample-003188 i guess i was home sick

sample-003232 the following night the boy cute the [vocalized-noise] tent with a horse 
sample-003233 he stood [vocalized-noise] regarding me 
sample-003234 i'm beginning to realize that 
sample-003237 the key wanted to not make a spectacle of herself 
sample-003241 you can hear out of it 
sample-003242 she in the judge like [vocalized-noise] and cabbage 
sample-003246 the young arab took out a book and began to read 
sample-003254 [vocalized-noise] 
sample-003258 trust in your heart the never forget that you're in the desert 
sample-003259 well then why do we need all these books the boy asked

sample-003269 he prepared himself a sandwich in drank somehow te- from a crystal glass 
sample-003274 to stuff into their own pockets

sample-003323 it was only one i got this close to it that the strangest of it was at all evident to me 
sample-003325 right that time it had not occurred troops that it might be hollow 
sample-003330 and he dropped his spayed picked up his jacket and came out into the road 
sample-003335 you can try using i jacket to accomplish this but the position isn't quite high enough 
sample-003342 the servant relaxed immediately 
sample-003344 one must prepare for it 
sample-003347 why shouldn't i make father my beneficiary 
sample-003349 what she uh 
sample-003350 these other spies said one of the man 
sample-003352 as fast as i can 
sample-003368 another dreamer said the take it somewhere to his the system watching the boy walk away 
sample-003369 the boy was [vocalized-noise] 
sample-003377 who could have predicted that 
sample-003386 at the first glance it was really not very exciting 
sample-003391 why do they need you had

sample-003440 i'll take mine now 
sample-003444 i'll see you get it and fifteen minutes 
sample-003446 you are wise because you observe everything from a distance the boy said

sample-003464 tell me more about your dream said the woman 
sample-003469 the boy stood of shake [vocalized-noise] and looked once more in the pyramids 
sample-003471 then she filled her [vocalized-noise] with water and left 
sample-003477 they got a way to breakfast at [vocalized-noise] house 
sample-003479 he's on the way 
sample-003480 water boarding is terrible form of torture 
sample-003486 it left a [vocalized-noise] streak that [vocalized-noise] for some second 
sample-003489 please don't make me 
sample-003493 i'll give it a drink 
sample-003498 that's too far from the bedroo- 
sample-003499 and the attack and [vocalized-noise] 
sample-003500 the boy was a prize and then you [vocalized-noise] 
sample-003504 i feel quite ambivalent about the article 
sample-003505 first they tried to find him honoring 
sample-003506 the son was turned in too golden this 
sample-003509 this is the [vocalized-noise] 
sample-003511 you didn't but for me the last time

sample-003529 i had that everyone has gary [vocalized-noise] teeth dream again 
sample-003532 it may be the gas is of the firing that caused the [vocalized-noise] and convenience 
sample-003534 we beat the whole country on that story 
sample-003535 you could see the other guy specifically how good at fighting he is 
sample-003540 but that was simply because my i was curd 
sample-003541 it seemed such a look thing so bright and small and still 
sample-003551 i'm going to build a bridge mile all 
sample-003553 he asked it please never to stop speaking to him 
sample-003555 but then you remember he wasn't going to have to pay anything 
sample-003556 some storms are worth the [vocalized-noise] 
sample-003562 we don't want him 
sample-003563 makes about five thousand a year 
sample-003564 one can imagine these two covered with sand running up the little street in the bright sunlight 
sample-003565 the burning f- had been [vocalized-noise] 
sample-003572 got the first their wool [vocalized-noise] from exhaustion including [vocalized-noise]

sample-003691 the [vocalized-noise] the way to white act-

sample-003711 so you began to wander through the city and found himself at the gates 
sample-003718 he could always go back to being a shepherd 
sample-003721 he knew he was strong [vocalized-noise] 
sample-003725 absolutely [vocalized-noise] [vocalized-noise] men are forced to live in houses made of their own flash 
sample-003727 this was the strangest of all things that ever came to earth from outer space 
sample-003728 the walls were covered with dark and scary sketch -is 
sample-003729 here i am between my flock in my treasure the boy thought 
sample-003732 i'm afraid it'll be steve tina 
sample-003733 don't even to your fears said the [vocalized-noise] in a strangely juggle voice 
sample-003735 it was seen early in the morning rushing over [vocalized-noise] word 
sample-003739 did you see the garden that it took the master gardener ten years to create 
sample-003740 he didn't suggested with his words but it's a little messages that's the trick

sample-003770 but bakers are more important people in shepherds 
sample-003778 well it tomorrow before sunrise was the [vocalized-noise] on ev- respon- 
sample-003781 but horses tired it by bit 
sample-003782 they began to ride out over the said [vocalized-noise] with the moonlighting their way 
sample-003783 just one more try 
sample-003789 i'll almost dropped him 
sample-003790 the combination was affordable and cozy 
sample-003792 the river [vocalized-noise] namely to itself 
sample-003793 the airplane rose gracefully into the sky 
sample-003795 the [vocalized-noise] ground was blackened as far as one could see and it was still giving off smoke 
sample-003796 but you might telling me who goes up 
sample-003799 get a load of this 
sample-003802 wouldn't do any good

sample-003832 something happens year you'll have to remember later on 
sample-003833 and if it is 
sample-003836 the tear had leather [vocalized-noise] 
sample-003852 the newspaper articles had prepared everyone the reception of the idea

sample-000200 at that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the thing had come from the planet mars 
sample-000201 that's not so bad 
sample-000203 he had seen the shooting star and was persuaded that a [vocalized-noise] la- somewhere nearby

sample-000217 just as your grandmother taught you 
sample-000220 two days later the merchant spoke to the boy about the display 
sample-000222 as he did so he talked with a long about the tribal wars 
sample-000228 that's why i'm here in the middle of hot desert 
sample-000229 might just as well be

sample-000299 sadly my dream of becoming a squirrel [vocalized-noise] may never happen 
sample-000303 the boy noticed that the man's clothing strange 
sample-000304 scattered group of people were hurrying from the direction of [vocalized-noise] 
sample-000306 somebody had returned my lost credit card to the bank 
sample-000315 the [vocalized-noise] of gas came out towards us 
sample-000317 i'm going to miss any- 
sample-000321 at most they thought that another [vocalized-noise] had [vocalized-noise] 
sample-000326 nobody's going to rush me into anything 
sample-000329 just what is a low down williams 
sample-000330 it's that what enters men's mouth that's evil said the [vocalized-noise]

sample-000337 he didn't change anything 
sample-000343 her height helped her with her fighting 
sample-000345 it seemed so safe and [vocalized-noise] 
sample-000347 goes always have a better view 
sample-000351 the turf and gravel around it seemed [vocalized-noise] as if by a sudden explosion 
sample-000352 how long is it 
sample-003855 no one seemed to have thought about that 
sample-003863 you should have seen the co- motion in that locker room 
sample-003866 coaches heard all about you 
sample-003873 the boy looked around for the ovens and other apparatus used in [vocalized-noise] but saw night 
sample-003876 it may be the gases of the fire in that caused the [vocalized-noise] inconvenience 
sample-003881 and then he perceive it very slowly

sample-003923 they set off running [vocalized-noise] into the trees 
sample-003925 i've the servants maintain the fires in the [vocalized-noise] 
sample-003928 next you want to in weight [vocalized-noise] quickly um [vocalized-noise] 
sample-003933 he really started his [vocalized-noise] that's what he has time 
sample-003937 but the market place [vocalized-noise] was far from home so he went 
sample-003939 and don't forget the language of [vocalized-noise] 
sample-003940 most [vocalized-noise] are more or less rounded 
sample-003941 i wonder what's eating that gold money [vocalized-noise] anyway 
sample-003945 [vocalized-noise] [vocalized-noise] uses pairs of keys 
sample-003948 you think of is on the witness stand 
sample-003949 with the bag of [vocalized-noise] 
sample-003952 the teller didn't know love chain 
sample-003955 it's not high the wind spoke about 
sample-003959 but i realize she could have been 
sample-003962 the boy reminded the old man that he had said something about hidden treasure 
sample-003968 he wanted to forget about the vision i return to his meditation 
sample-003971 i return just as your father came back to your mother he said 
sample-003975 it had a diameter of about thirty yards 
sample-003979 he wasn't asking for help 
sample-003987 that guy over their likes a drink lot talk a lot back to nothing 
sample-003991 the seems golden wise 
sample-004003 they set off running [vocalized-noise] into the trees 
sample-004005 they formed [vocalized-noise] but that visible a mile and a half away 
sample-004009 although searching in binary search trees is efficient you won't find any fruits in there 
sample-004014 they were no nice [vocalized-noise] and they were held in there by [vocalized-noise] and the [vocalized-noise] 
sample-004015 trying to improve the world by jumping up and down 
sample-004016 we still we can't be bothered now 
sample-004017 it must have fallen while i was sitting over there 
sample-004023 you want the moan 
sample-004028 the one in there

sample-001077 i heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit 
sample-001080 the guy thought he was a lunatic at large and made an [vocalized-noise] attempt to stop him
