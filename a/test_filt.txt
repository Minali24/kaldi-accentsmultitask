sample-000004 he moved about invisible but everyone could hear him
sample-000005 but everything had changed
sample-000008 the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their bedroom windows
sample-000009 the teacher thought that he'd taught himself all he could
sample-000013 in those days very few of the people had any idea about astronomy
sample-000020 coming home a party of tourists passed us singing and playing music
sample-000021 next install an extension that makes it possible to add custom python commands
sample-000022 the boy had met the alchemist
sample-000029 are you gonna throw a rock
sample-000034 i want to see that map covered before we get through
sample-000041 i don't know where to go
sample-000045 i was scared but wasted no time in going out and crossing the bridge to the sand pits
sample-000046 we must be good
sample-000052 he needed someone to talk to so as to avoid thinking about the possibility of war
sample-000053 almost everyone here speaks spanish
sample-000054 the report was largely scathing
sample-000056 where's the old goat
sample-000057 before guns were invented armies had to throw bullets at each other and if a bullet touched you you had to sit out until the next war
sample-000058 it was the time of day when all of spain slept during the summer
sample-000059 there were mountains in the distance
sample-000060 excuse you for what
sample-000061 yesterday i waited forever for the subway train
sample-000066 it was glaringly hot not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind
sample-000067 compiling the linux kernel can be time consuming
sample-000068 if that guy lays an egg
sample-000070 sadly my dream of becoming a squirrel whisperer may never happen
sample-000073 the achieved results are far behind the stateoftheart in image classification
sample-000074 i'll be back in a minute
sample-000080 two more months passed and the shelf brought many customers into the crystal shop
sample-000082 at least she knows how to behave at funerals
sample-000083 look at the policy i gave him
sample-000085 i got two giant bug bites on my right leg from last night and they hurt
sample-000091 what was all that
sample-000094 we can't let the chronicle get the laugh on us
sample-000098 hunches his mother used to call them
sample-000100 vibrations of peace throughout the tent
sample-000102 they were in an immense setting surrounded by thousands of people speaking a strange language
sample-000110 in some places the ground was covered with the salt of driedup lakes
sample-000111 that's why i was sent down here
sample-000113 he had come to the town only to find a woman who could interpret his dream
sample-000115 for some reason we were blocked from entering
sample-000117 but you are in the desert
sample-000119 she refilled her vessel and left
sample-000123 all the joy he had seen that morning had suddenly disappeared
sample-000128 i got drunk yesterday and thought i built a super computer
sample-000129 he was immensely excited at the news
sample-000130 using script blockers is generally a good idea but it requires the user to learn a bit
sample-000132 he's home cooking dinner
sample-000135 he just got a new kite for his birthday
sample-000136 the ceiling collapsed inwards
sample-000139 we want to sell handmade chukka boots in that food truck
sample-000142 and you married her
sample-000145 few people realise the immensity of vacancy
sample-000149 now leave us alone said the boy to the young arab
sample-000152 i'm not hiding anything the boy answered
sample-000153 a large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered
sample-000155 it's not what enters men's mouths that's evil said the alchemist
sample-000159 the first rule of don't fight club is let's talk about it
sample-000162 he only lost three buttons off his vest
sample-000163 i think we can do better after the boat sails
sample-000167 the boy was relieved
sample-000171 few people realise the immensity of vacancy
sample-000173 you're right when you say my father was no business man
sample-000175 what boat you sailing on
sample-000180 what a load of trash sarah opined
sample-000182 the teenagers put on red hoodies for their annual toboggan run
sample-000184 berlin can be so lovely this time of year
sample-000185 laura took out a cigarette and placed it in her mouth
sample-000187 the vision vanished immediately but it had shaken him
sample-000190 the omens had told him so
sample-000196 when he was a child that man wanted to travel too
sample-000200 at that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the thing had come from the planet mars
sample-000201 that's not so bad
sample-000203 he had seen the shooting star and was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere nearby
sample-000206 the alchemists spent years in their laboratories observing the fire that purified the metals
sample-000208 any decent editor can show you line numbers and let you jump to a specific line
sample-000213 i want my garden to be filled with roses petunias and passion flowers
sample-000217 just as your grandfather taught you
sample-000220 two days later the merchant spoke to the boy about the display
sample-000222 as he did so he talked with the monk about the tribal wars
sample-000228 that's why i'm here in the middle of het desert
sample-000229 might just as well be
sample-000232 let's have your story
sample-000234 on the first day he returned with a rabbit and on the second with two birds
sample-000241 it's practically up there now
sample-000249 you have a mania for simplifying everything answered the englishman irritated
sample-000250 where she used to live
sample-000255 the boy was becoming nervous
sample-000260 they play duets together
sample-000261 he didn't know the man yet but his practiced eye would recognize him when he appeared
sample-000262 i'll be right back
sample-000268 hires two personal trainers and make one of them train the other one
sample-000277 of course he's coming back here
sample-000291 i'm dying for what i believe
sample-000296 they were relieved and happy
sample-000298 what did i tell you
sample-000299 sadly my dream of becoming a squirrel whisperer may never happen
sample-000303 the boy noticed that the man's clothing was strange
sample-000304 scattered groups of people were hurrying from the direction of woking
sample-000306 somebody had returned my lost credit card to the bank
sample-000315 the streamer of gas came out towards us
sample-000317 i'm going to miss annie
sample-000321 at most they thought that another meteorite had descended
sample-000326 nobody's going to rush me into anything
sample-000329 just what is the lowdown on williams
sample-000330 it's not what enters men's mouths that's evil said the alchemist
sample-000331 the greatest authority on meteorites stated that the height of its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles
sample-000333 what does that get us
sample-000335 love required them to stay with the people they loved
sample-000337 it didn't change anything
sample-000343 her height helped her with her fighting
sample-000345 it seemed so safe and tranquil
sample-000347 goats always have a better view
sample-000351 the turf and gravel around it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion
sample-000352 how long is it
sample-000355 it was dropping off in flakes and raining down on the sand
sample-000356 where you got him
sample-000358 we don't know when the war will end so we can't continue our journey he said
sample-000359 his new friend pushed the owner aside and pulled the boy outside with him
sample-000365 she set it on the shelf and there it stayed
sample-000367 the boy was strong and wanted to retaliate but he was in a foreign country
sample-000375 it's called the principle of favorability beginner's luck
sample-000377 i'm just a man who wanders the desert and knows the stars said the alchemist
sample-000387 i got two giant bug bites on my right leg from last night and they hurt
sample-000388 now you listen to me
sample-000393 the immense collection of people and animals began to travel faster
sample-000405 she was supposed to come down and get you
sample-000406 artificial neural networks can do something very similar
sample-000415 it was a litmus test
sample-000425 what's the good of arguing about something that probably doesn't exist
sample-000429 without responding the guard entered the tent where he remained for some time
sample-000435 and then he perceived it very slowly
sample-000436 i would appreciate if you could create a concise table
sample-000438 don't you push me around like that
sample-000441 they were looking only for gold his companion answered
sample-000444 you're supposed to be the one that has all the answers
sample-000447 the high humidity is making me sweat
sample-000453 well usually i learn more from my sheep than from books he answered
sample-000454 adam is a crook
sample-000456 this is for you he said holding one of the parts out to the monk
sample-000458 and i told harry i thought i'd be bored to death
sample-000460 how do you think the table looks
sample-000461 putting a pool under this floor was a great idea
sample-000463 i want to see him do it said the chief
sample-000465 bacon pancakes and maple syrup is a hearty start to any day
sample-000466 i never knew grandma to be so determined before
sample-000467 the genies were the spirits of good and evil
sample-000468 it's true life really is generous to those who pursue their destiny the boy thought
sample-000470 he said he had never seen any like them
sample-000483 i know why i want to get back to my flock he thought
sample-000489 maybe these desert birds could explain to him the meaning of love without ownership
sample-000492 send those other people in
sample-000497 he was just and good
sample-000502 without the dataset the article is useless
sample-000509 my tax dollars pay for those public school proms
sample-000515 how are the weights computed
sample-000520 and it's not love to see everything from a distance like you do
sample-000528 i told you that your dream was a difficult one
sample-000532 shoot through the desk
sample-000546 a thin circle of bright metal showed between the top and the body of the cylinder
sample-000549 the old man returned the book to the boy
sample-000550 and i think it's terrific
sample-000553 it was only when i got this close to it that the strangeness of it was at all evident to me
sample-000557 but it is not a class that was requested by our alumni or prospective students
sample-000558 the time must have been somewhere around six o'clock
sample-000561 i'll always let you down
sample-000562 the old man returned the book to the boy
sample-000563 they made the boy continue digging but he found nothing
sample-000564 the basketball bounced off his shield of titanium
sample-000565 but you don't know about love
sample-000566 the wind has many names
sample-000569 throughout the night the boy dug at the place he had chosen but found nothing
sample-000573 all that time the martians must have been getting ready
sample-000576 i've learned things from the sheep and i've learned things from crystal he thought
sample-000579 how should i know
sample-000587 the englishman had been profoundly impressed by the story
sample-000597 sometimes their caravan met with another
sample-000605 the boy picked up his pouch and put it with his other things
sample-000608 the war is going to end someday the girl said
sample-000609 he needed someone to talk to so as to avoid thinking about the possibility of war
sample-000613 the thought was so dreadful to him that he forgot about the heat and went forward
sample-000614 that's true enough the boy thought ruefully
sample-000615 and maybe it wasn't that they were teaching me but that i was learning from them
sample-000616 the horizon was tinged with red and suddenly the sun appeared
sample-000619 the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their bedroom windows
sample-000620 i was wondering if you could tell me a bit more about what it's like to live and work there
sample-000622 maybe these desert birds could explain to him the meaning of love without ownership
sample-000623 i got doctor bills to pay
sample-000624 dusk was falling as the boy arrived with his herd at an abandoned church
sample-000625 i've been all over town
sample-000626 let me see it
sample-000628 he told fatima that at their next meeting
sample-000629 all things are one
sample-000630 think i'll go home and see what the family is doing
sample-000631 the nearby city of ceuta had grown faster than tangier and business had fallen off
sample-000634 i found these one day in the fields
sample-000638 you have been a real blessing to me
sample-000639 but he had to move on
sample-000642 what did she say
sample-000644 the boy began again to read his book but he was no longer able to concentrate
sample-000649 they become the soul o f the world
sample-000652 the pixel probabilities are conditioned on the model state
sample-000653 the navy's going to fly father home this afternoon
sample-000655 his eyes filled with tears as he spoke of the prophet
sample-000656 it spread through the planet's atmosphere and obscured its more familiar features
sample-000658 the trees swayed uniformly in the breeze
sample-000666 when the pan had cooled the monk and the boy looked at it dazzled
sample-000667 you'd better get your friends
sample-000668 and now it was only four days before he would be back in that same village
sample-000671 maybe these desert birds could explain to him the meaning of love without ownership
sample-000673 bill decided that management should know about this incident
sample-000678 who engineered this getaway
sample-000682 you'll weaken when you see that little jezebel
sample-000686 they just won't let anybody talk politics to them
sample-000694 help me the boy said
sample-000695 there were just drawings coded instructions and obscure texts
sample-000699 i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
sample-000702 he hoped that it would be someone as capable as his previous apprentice
sample-000706 there is no wine in this country the young man said
sample-000712 it's easy and yet i've never done it before he thought
sample-000714 where did he keep his money
sample-000716 absolutely despicable that gingerbread men are forced to live in houses made of their own flesh
sample-000717 at once he connected the two incidents
sample-000719 hires two personal trainers and make one of them train the other one
sample-000720 it was bunched up and he had hardly thought of it for a long time
sample-000721 it was an element of her sexuality
sample-000726 he put a sign on the door and they went to a small cafe nearby
sample-000729 the wind has many names
sample-000731 please don't cry
sample-000735 the boy knew and was now working toward it
sample-000740 some of the grey ash was falling off the circular edge
sample-000745 but you've got to leave me alone
sample-000747 you wanna take this outside
sample-000748 all you've got to do is talk to him
sample-000750 the world speaks many languages the boy thought
sample-000752 i don't think it's very ethical reading other people's stuff
sample-000755 can i see blood orgy of the leather girls at a movie house
sample-000758 i hope some of the lines make you smile
sample-000759 they formed heaps that are visible a mile and a half away
sample-000760 show me some gratitude
sample-000764 everyone seemed very excited
sample-000766 let's go and have some lunch said the crystal merchant
sample-000771 the men fell into an animated discussion
sample-000780 it's a simple story
sample-000782 that's almost a hundred dollars a week
sample-000785 i'm hunting with my falcon the alchemist answered
sample-000787 one can imagine these two covered with sand running up the little street in the bright sunlight
sample-000789 the italian got her words mixed up
sample-000790 and find out where the nearest telegraph office is
sample-000791 i always have been
sample-000792 of course this only reduces the severity of the problem
sample-000793 then why do you suppose he hasn't at least called up
sample-000794 i'm already used to the way things are
sample-000801 i won't shut up
sample-000803 then he dropped his spade picked up his jacket and came out into the road
sample-000809 you're in luck you two the fat arab said
sample-000811 i myself heard nothing of that
sample-000815 like everybody learns he said
sample-000827 and it goes for you too
sample-000832 i've got the party here
sample-000838 it brought his heart into his mouth
sample-000845 i don't understand what you're talking about the desert said
sample-000847 i ain't seen him for a week
sample-000851 they formed heaps that are visible a mile and a half away
sample-000852 is daddy in trouble
sample-000855 the boy awoke before dawn
sample-000856 it's extremely suspicious that there's no information about brains that didn't come from a brain
sample-000860 that's why i'm quitting
sample-000861 who is your favourite author
sample-000865 there are only eight flags up there now
sample-000870 the article should contain url where the dataset can be downloaded
sample-000877 if i had told you you wouldn't have seen the pyramids
sample-000880 and he wasn't faring much better
sample-000881 he noticed the unequal cooling of its surface
sample-000891 didn't you tell her
sample-000893 the battles may last for a long time perhaps even years
sample-000909 we know that and we are used to it
sample-000912 the news was chilling to say the least
sample-000913 at that point the omens will tell you that your treasure is buried forever
sample-000926 turning the air conditioning on leads to an increased fuel consumption
sample-000929 that's true the boy thought
sample-000934 i wouldn't live in it as a ghost
sample-000935 tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself
sample-000936 but they're somebody's children
sample-000941 too bad i couldn't see this guy first
sample-000946 one is loved because one is loved
sample-000950 as the sun rose the men began to beat the boy
sample-000952 what do you mean by that
sample-000953 given only the public key it is very hard to compute the private one
sample-000955 we have also started contemplating the possibility of moving back to colorado
sample-000956 the news was chilling to say the least
sample-000968 the sheep had taught him that
sample-000969 you don't have to apologize
sample-000972 darren never saw a bottle till he was six months old
sample-000980 they say it's a fake
sample-000981 the boy thought of fatima
sample-000984 luke i am your sister
sample-000985 folk is not my favorite music genre
sample-000988 i want them both arrested
sample-000989 we miss you and miss having a friend like you and i am so happy that you two got to catch up
sample-000997 these are not camels
sample-001004 upon returning to the wise man he related in detail everything he had seen
sample-001011 of course the two were unable to do anything
sample-001016 my dog gave her life to save my child
sample-001020 curse the moment i met that old man he thought
sample-001022 there were raised voicesand some sort of struggle appeared to be going on
sample-001024 the snake slithered toward the shaded boulders under the cliff
sample-001027 it was a pleasant change from talking to his sheep
sample-001032 but they were not there
sample-001033 don't you know there are nine jobs waiting for this guy
sample-001036 sandra read aloud the strange excerpt
sample-001038 the criminals taunted the police officers and prison guards
sample-001040 the boy began again to read his book but he was no longer able to concentrate
sample-001045 starting with his own
sample-001049 i'll work all night until dawn and i'll clean every piece of crystal in your shop
sample-001050 but arms cannot be drawn unless they also go into battle
sample-001057 if a person is living out his destiny he knows everything he needs to know
sample-001062 they seemed to laugh at him and he laughed back his heart bursting with joy
sample-001063 laser tag is a game quite similar to paintball
sample-001065 you can't go any farther one of them said
sample-001066 i don't believe it
sample-001068 the boy didn't know what to say
sample-001077 i heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit
sample-001080 the guy thought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful attempt to stop him
sample-001084 only chris couldn't wait quite as long as the others
sample-001085 now i want you to sign this agreement
sample-001088 suddenly he disappeared and i could hear a faint shriek behind the walls
sample-001093 be careful with your prognostications said the stranger
sample-001098 you have been stopping me
sample-001111 they'd never let you go
sample-001116 scattered groups of people were hurrying from the direction of woking
sample-001117 he had done this for years and knew the schedule of everyone who passed
sample-001120 the burning fire had been extinguished
sample-001126 love is the falcon's flight over your sands
sample-001127 absolutely despicable that gingerbread men are forced to live in houses made of their own flesh
sample-001134 down below in the darkness were hundreds of people sleeping in peace
sample-001135 then suddenly he noticed it with a start
sample-001137 i shall make us some ice cubes
sample-001140 i have had the same dream twice he said
sample-001142 because you are trying to realize your destiny
sample-001150 but horses tire bit by bit
sample-001159 the top of the cylinder was rotating on its body
sample-001166 wilmas gone cat sitting again for the weekend if you want to come over
sample-001167 that night there was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet
sample-001178 i can't please everybody
sample-001182 i need you to be spontaneous he asked me out to din din
sample-001185 vibrations of peace throughout the tent
sample-001186 the time must have been somewhere around six o'clock
sample-001188 used to hunt rabbits there myself
sample-001192 it drew a droplet of blood
sample-001200 the little girl wanted to have a balloon but was too shy to ask
sample-001203 you're here rather early
sample-001204 the streamer of gas came out towards us
sample-001206 oxygen is important for us but some bacteria don't need it at all
sample-001213 so usually a keypress instead of a click is used
sample-001214 it's in all the afternoon papers
sample-001215 if you can concentrate always on the present you'll be a happy man
sample-001218 but as he saw them lying there on the ground another phrase came to his mind
sample-001219 what a terrible thing to say
sample-001221 but now the sounds inside had stopped
sample-001222 he moved about invisible but everyone could hear him
sample-001225 that's the way it always is said the old man
sample-001227 i think it's about bird hunting but now i can see how that might be misinterpreted
sample-001231 we're refugees from the tribal wars and we need money the other figure said
sample-001246 after all who doesnt want to overcome new challenges and achieve great heights
sample-001249 they looked for the fallen mass but found nothing
sample-001263 the boy's name was santiago
sample-001272 every search begins with beginner's luck
sample-001273 how about that one there
sample-001275 did you ever walk into this office
sample-001279 my friend bought all the other sheep immediately
sample-001280 the boy was suddenly happy to be there at the warehouse
sample-001282 you know i'd tell you if i had it
sample-001293 everyone is just standing by the building waiting to get in
sample-001296 strange images passed through my mind
sample-001301 he's trying to trick you again
sample-001302 it's a code said the boy a bit disappointed
sample-001303 tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself
sample-001306 they were men of the desert and they were fearful of sorcerers
sample-001307 i'd better see what he's up to
sample-001316 it was starlight and i explained the signs of the zodiac to her
sample-001317 i don't want anything for myself
sample-001319 never give up
sample-001325 but i found it difficult to get to work because of the investigations
sample-001328 but that's what you're doing
sample-001331 you'll be the counselor of the oasis
sample-001333 hitting the delete and escape keys did nothing
sample-001335 didn't i tell you never to come panhandling around here
sample-001336 how is mozilla going to handle ambiguities like queue and cue
sample-001340 who is it from
sample-001342 much better said the old man
sample-001345 i ain't gonna squeal
sample-001349 mostly just the hearts of those who are trying to realize their destinies
sample-001354 the night was warm and i was thirsty
sample-001358 i am proud of you he said
sample-001359 it was only when i got this close to it that the strangeness of it was at all evident to me
sample-001361 and i'm going to build things
sample-001364 the thing itself was almost entirely buried in sand
sample-001365 since the miner had sacrificed everything to his destiny the old man decided to become involved
sample-001367 the thing itself was almost entirely buried in sand
sample-001368 drawing from my own experience as a learner of english and german i value engaging activities that involve everyday conversation
sample-001372 if we serve tea in crystal the shop is going to expand
sample-001381 it was just ripe enough to eat
sample-001388 it is i the boy answered
sample-001390 they're not my sheep anymore he said to himself without nostalgia
sample-001394 he wandered for a while keeping the date palms of the oasis within sight
sample-001395 and then he perceived it very slowly
sample-001396 hitting the delete and escape keys did nothing
sample-001398 how long will it take to get him examined
sample-001401 they were men of the desert and they were fearful of sorcerers
sample-001405 i heard a faint movement under my feet
sample-001406 henderson stood up with a spade in his hand
sample-001408 only we call them agents
sample-001410 how they managed to improvise at such short notice she'll never know
sample-001426 the boy was shaking with fear but the alchemist helped him out of the tent
sample-001427 it looked like a rusty gas float
sample-001433 let's go and have some lunch said the crystal merchant
sample-001437 the shop is exactly the size i always wanted it to be
sample-001444 so how will we name all these hurricanes
sample-001450 i heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit
sample-001453 that sounds like their problem
sample-001455 and so do i
sample-001456 the scale model of the architects plans sat at the center of the conference room
sample-001459 my keyboard is filled with dust
sample-001461 this samantha tommy movement costs you a fortune
sample-001464 it's a code said the boy a bit disappointed
sample-001467 that's a good idea
sample-001469 some went away while i was there and other people came
sample-001475 who's got the room next to hers
sample-001477 what on earth are you doing
sample-001479 it looked like a rusty gas float
sample-001480 something inside the cylinder was unscrewing the top
sample-001484 then a man approached
sample-001488 but where are the houses
sample-001489 isn't it just beautiful
sample-001492 it rattled menacingly
sample-001493 the boy wanted to take her hand
sample-001494 i had the everyone has gary busey's teeth dream again
sample-001496 the same hand that had brandished the sword now held a whip
sample-001499 you didn't have to do any cleaning he said
sample-001500 just use the phone
sample-001511 i don't want anything for myself
sample-001515 he picked up the two stones and put them back in his pouch
sample-001517 you came so that you could learn about your dreams said the old woman
sample-001519 i was scared but wasted no time in going out and crossing the bridge to the sand pits
sample-001520 the caterpillar responded with a nod
sample-001529 i want to do what i want to do
sample-001537 i don't even know who i'm talking to any more
sample-001549 and he looked out over the desert that had brought him to the woman he loved
sample-001553 you don't have to smell the world
sample-001554 whatever the thing observed one could find a connection with his experience of the moment
sample-001556 everyone seemed very excited
sample-001558 that brings you good luck for ten years
sample-001561 but he didn't need to worry about that right now
sample-001562 at the first glance it was really not very exciting
sample-001563 she must have known alex pretty well
sample-001564 all who went there were happy at having done so
sample-001567 he stood irresolute for a moment and then scrambled out of the pit
sample-001568 we've been fed baloney so long we're getting used to it
sample-001575 let me comb your hair
sample-001578 think i'll go home and see what the family is doing
sample-001580 that's what i'd like to know
sample-001581 the boy was shaking with fear but the alchemist helped him out of the tent
sample-001593 you'd better start right now
sample-001596 you're through deciding anything
sample-001599 but there were certain of them who took a bit longer to awaken
sample-001600 give me my robe
sample-001606 who'd you say it was
sample-001611 have you any idea what these things cost over here
sample-001612 aiding an escaped criminal
sample-001614 but children always seem to be able to play with them without frightening them
sample-001618 i don't see a thing
sample-001620 it's a code said the boy a bit disappointed
sample-001624 that first day everyone slept from exhaustion including the englishman
sample-001625 the infidels had an evil look about them
sample-001629 the boy felt ill and terribly alone
sample-001630 but the boy knew that he was referring to fatima
sample-001631 maybe he'll give us one
sample-001634 what was written on the emerald tablet the boy wanted to know
sample-001638 my freezer contains enough for a banquet
sample-001650 how long is it
sample-001651 how many times are you gonna call me
sample-001656 he decided to stay right there and await his return
sample-001659 that's a good idea
sample-001665 it was dropping off in flakes and raining down on the sand
sample-001673 the engines roared as the rocket lifted its precious cargo up into the atmosphere
sample-001675 down below in the darkness were hundreds of people sleeping in peace
sample-001682 and so do i
sample-001684 strange images passed through my mind
sample-001691 the englishman asked if they were in danger
sample-001694 what a wonderful weather
sample-001695 how do you stop this thing
sample-001699 the alchemists spent years in their laboratories observing the fire that purified the metals
sample-001705 then i don't get paid
sample-001709 licorice is a black chewy food
sample-001710 but he had to move on
sample-001711 i was impatient to see it opened
sample-001712 the dead soldiers were replaced by others and life went on
sample-001713 it's gonna put our city on the map
sample-001720 the boy's name was santiago
sample-001721 this is for you
sample-001723 you dominated those horsemen with the way you looked at them he said
sample-001724 the omens had told him so
sample-001726 we must stay hidden
sample-001728 how'd you happen to fall in
sample-001730 if you start your emails with greetings let me be the first to welcome you to earth
sample-001731 if i could i'd write a huge encyclopedia just about the words luck and coincidence
sample-001733 there were lights in the upper windows of the houses when the people went to bed
sample-001738 then suddenly he noticed it with a start
sample-001741 it's still sopping wet
sample-001746 my seven year resume gap is marked not drugs
sample-001750 how long since we've seen each other
sample-001758 i have already described the appearance of that colossal bulk which was embedded in the ground
sample-001759 you have to cross the entire sahara desert said the young man
sample-001766 the men of the desert were already familiar with that wind
sample-001769 mind if i sit down
sample-001771 something's the matter with daddy
sample-001772 i know what it's going to be like
sample-001781 then it became a signal of danger
sample-001783 you know i'd tell you if i had it
sample-001785 they have their eyes glued on his face
sample-001786 when i had my sheep i was happy and i made those around me happy
sample-001789 if only we could see it
sample-001795 i had seen all that it would presently bring me
sample-001799 it was dropping off in flakes and raining down on the sand
sample-001803 he walked slowly through the market
sample-001807 then she took both of his hands in hers and began quietly to pray
sample-001808 it was rising slowly and painfully out of the cylinder
sample-001811 love is the force that transforms and improves the soul of the world
sample-001813 we don't know what's in the confounded thing do you
sample-001820 i just know that the tradition is always right
sample-001824 the first rule of don't fight club is let's talk about it
sample-001826 almost everyone here speaks spanish
sample-001830 storm increasing over the rockies
sample-001837 but they really don't know what they're saying
sample-001845 there were mountains in the distance
sample-001850 i'm going to them
sample-001851 what had been next to him five minutes ago was now at the other side
sample-001854 it was faintly marked with transverse stripes and slightly flattened from the perfect round
sample-001859 what do they want
sample-001875 it seemed such a little thing so bright and small and still
sample-001877 i myself heard nothing of that
sample-001883 that's what i was sent down for
sample-001892 i'll get it for you
sample-001899 if i could i'd write a huge encyclopedia just about the words luck and coincidence
sample-001901 maybe it was because they moved around so much
sample-001907 from here on you will be alone the alchemist said
sample-001908 the first rule of don't fight club is let's talk about it
sample-001915 from atop its walls one can catch a glimpse of africa
sample-001917 lots of places sell tea around here the merchant said
sample-001918 the streamer of gas came out towards us
sample-001920 but just before lunchtime a boy stopped in front of the shop
sample-001925 about time one of you lunkheads said it
sample-001926 this is for you
sample-001927 all things are one the old man had said
sample-001930 i heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit
sample-001935 the desert didn't answer him for a few moments
sample-001938 today i understand something i didn't see before every blessing ignored becomes a curse
sample-001939 it was glaringly hot not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind
sample-001944 the boy knew a lot of people in the city
sample-001948 the top had certainly ceased to rotate
sample-001949 when he saw henderson in his garden he called over the fence and made himself understood
sample-001952 he didn't need to seek out the old woman for this
sample-001953 once you get into the desert there's no going back said the camel driver
sample-001959 no baselines or comparison to state of the art is provided
sample-001963 that's what makes it romantic
sample-001974 you should see the other guy specifically how good at fighting he is
sample-001979 he approached the mass and was surprised at the size and the shape
sample-001981 the space station rocked violently due to the intense pressure wave from the airlock failure
sample-001984 if good things are coming they will be a pleasant surprise said the seer
sample-001986 kidneys are transplanted often because every healthy person has two of them
sample-001991 it was impossible to remember all the details that he covered in an hour
sample-001994 if what one finds is made of pure matter it will never spoil
sample-001995 i'm going away he said
sample-002000 the boy felt a pang in his heart thinking about the merchant's daughter
sample-002006 now i will drift gently off to dreamland
sample-002008 those women are all card sharks don't be fooled
sample-002012 keep your shirt on
sample-002015 he decanted the wine and began to recount the disturbing story he had been told
sample-002019 i want them both arrested
sample-002020 the list was frighteningly extensive
sample-002035 the loafers and golf caddies were used to hanging out near the railway station
sample-002043 one can imagine these two covered with sand running up the little street in the bright sunlight
sample-002044 about how wealthy would you say
sample-002046 we lit the lantern and walked over to his house
sample-002047 the three fell silent
sample-002049 i'm a sucker for this country
sample-002054 no the alchemist answered
sample-002062 hires two personal trainers and make one of them train the other one
sample-002071 the sword didn't fall
sample-002074 but finally the merchant appeared and asked the boy to shear four sheep
sample-002077 life is beautiful
sample-002079 i hope it works
sample-002081 i don't know who anybody is any more
sample-002082 she's good enough for me
sample-002083 the steel of its blade glittered in the light of the moon
sample-002084 you fight it cut
sample-002085 we've certainly been in some sweet jams
sample-002087 the terror was palpable
sample-002089 i heard a faint movement under my feet
sample-002090 i'm trying to think of something before those reporters get back
sample-002094 the boy began to dig into the dune
sample-002096 can i help you asked the man behind the window
sample-002097 it's true that everything has its destiny but one day that destiny will be realized
sample-002101 who'd you say was gonna get him
sample-002102 who do you want
sample-002104 you'd better take it easy
sample-002110 i'll just go upstairs and send it over with a messenger
sample-002113 maybe no one here knows what an alchemist is
sample-002122 let me speak to her
sample-002124 the conquered half of the world on her horse's back
sample-002125 she had no temperature
sample-002128 he dressed in his arabian clothing of white linen bought especially for this day
sample-002136 the monk laughed when he saw me come back in tatters
sample-002138 a drought hit western europe
sample-002151 reading between the lines requires understanding
sample-002152 the alchemist removed the pan from the fire and set it aside to cool
sample-002156 after writing a bug report one should regularly check if someone responded
sample-002158 lighthouses in a foggy world
sample-002165 on the first day he returned with a rabbit and on the second with two birds
sample-002166 be sure you spell the name right
sample-002167 it must have fallen while i was sitting over there
sample-002168 i hold the power of life and death for every person i take with me
sample-002170 his grandfather was a snake
sample-002173 i felt a chill down my spine
sample-002177 they formed heaps that are visible a mile and a half away
sample-002181 think i'll go home and see what the family is doing
sample-002184 please bring mama back
sample-002185 it looked like a rusty gas float
sample-002190 may i go in and see him
sample-002192 so what do you want of me the sun asked
sample-002196 don't you understand french
sample-002200 you know what i mean
sample-002204 isnt this a parameter of the method
sample-002206 which one of these men is it
sample-002216 my name's pete davis
sample-002219 i was torn between fear and curiosity
sample-002220 the thought was so dreadful to him that he forgot about the heat and went forward
sample-002221 sometimes there's just no way to hold back the river
sample-002222 when you are loved you can do anything in creation
sample-002226 and you know it as well as i do
sample-002228 i thought about the difficulties in translation that might arise
sample-002232 they forgot that lead copper and iron have their own destinies to fulfill
sample-002237 he brought six sheep with him
sample-002241 there was very little talking
sample-002242 i have had the same dream twice he said
sample-002245 then suddenly he noticed it with a start
sample-002246 if i had told you you wouldn't have seen the pyramids
sample-002248 it's candice now on long distance from washington
sample-002250 it's a simple story
sample-002252 it considers the horizontal dimension as time
sample-002255 about eleven i walked back to my home in maybury because nothing seemed to be happening
sample-002257 the boy was surprised and then irritated
sample-002263 why was it that he wanted the boy to serve as his instrument
sample-002264 no one paid any attention to the two travelers
sample-002267 they rode for the entire day
sample-002271 he couldn't have been wrong
sample-002272 and the leader posted armed sentinels at the fringes of the group
sample-002275 i thought the unscrewing might be automatic
sample-002277 gotta be gentle to suit me
sample-002283 he almost began to tell about his treasure but decided not to do so
sample-002290 it must be some kind of a gag
sample-002292 he was excited and at the same time uneasy maybe the girl had already forgotten him
sample-002299 i'm afraid that if my dream is realized i'll have no reason to go on living
sample-002301 venus is far too hot for exploration
sample-002304 they shouted consolation and promises and went off back to the town again to get help
sample-002307 this puts me in a peculiar hole
sample-002309 like everybody learns he said
sample-002313 let's dance
sample-002316 it was a cobra whose venom could kill a person in minutes
sample-002327 yet each felt his heart beat a bit faster
sample-002331 a thin circle of bright metal showed between the top and the body of the cylinder
sample-002337 there wasn't much impetus to finish our chores
sample-002338 his soul must be too primitive to understand those things he thought
sample-002339 my mother just called you
sample-002341 html is not a programming language
sample-002361 this is my last chance
sample-002371 he had suddenly remembered that in tarifa there was an old woman who interpreted dreams
sample-002372 on the first day he returned with a rabbit and on the second with two birds
sample-002377 i won a flower
sample-002380 the heather was on fire and you could see a thin blue smoke rising up slowly
sample-002381 we'll leave tomorrow before sunrise was the alchemist's only response
sample-002385 and what do you do in salem he insisted
sample-002397 and tomorrow his enemy would also be a part of that soul
sample-002408 thanks for dropping around
sample-002425 your husband must have been in a great hurry
sample-002427 well then why do we need all these books the boy asked
sample-002433 sometimes their caravan met with another
sample-002436 another trick the boy thought
sample-002440 there's not a reason on earth why you should
sample-002441 about eleven i walked back to my home in maybury because nothing seemed to be happening
sample-002444 how could it be awkward
sample-002445 he ran his fingers slowly over the stones sensing their temperature and feeling their surfaces
sample-002452 i encourage everyone to contribute their voice to project common voice
sample-002460 he's insane or drunk or something
sample-002461 when i returned to the common the sun was setting
sample-002465 i want to do what i want to do
sample-002469 looking through the telescope i saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planet
sample-002470 it was a strange furnace fueled by firewood with a transparent flask heating on top
sample-002471 i didn't fall in
sample-002473 he was older and was carrying a small bucket
sample-002475 among these people were a couple of cyclists a gardener i employed sometimes and a girl carrying a baby
sample-002479 keep your shirt on
sample-002480 the police finally manage to get him out of the park
sample-002487 my father fell in love with him
sample-002489 i couldn't work in the city
sample-002495 the actor's authentic facial expression was convincing the jury
sample-002496 as soon as he saw me among the crowd he called to me to come down
sample-002504 in any case it's good that you've learned that everything in life has its price
sample-002510 can i go now
sample-002511 twins are known to be confounding
sample-002513 as jennifer walked down the aisle she wondered if she had made a mistake
sample-002514 what are you doing around here
sample-002515 i'm trying to explain to my mother how to get pictures off her phone
sample-002521 of course it is
sample-002527 the jacket had a purpose and so did the boy
sample-002529 it rattled menacingly
sample-002533 i'm hunting with my falcon the alchemist answered
sample-002534 some of the grey ash was falling off the circular edge
sample-002537 how do you know she didn't
sample-002539 of course the two were unable to do anything
sample-002543 you have helped me the man continued to prepare his tea saying nothing
sample-002544 today's world is full of commercials
sample-002546 they had gone away to breakfast at henderson's house
sample-002549 until then he had considered the omens to be things of this world
sample-002554 as was mecca for the merchant
sample-002558 what's going on here
sample-002562 i hate to think that i will have to leave but i guess thats not really up to me
sample-002569 the boy was sad as he left her that day
sample-002578 and he gets it right away
sample-002580 what's so depressing about that
sample-002590 the thief wasn't there and the owner brought him a cup of tea
sample-002592 cause you know how politicians are
sample-002597 the burning fire had been extinguished
sample-002603 in order to find the treasure you will have to follow the omens
sample-002606 the snake fought frantically making hissing sounds that shattered the silence of the desert
sample-002611 it was the old man who spoke first
sample-002612 an huge hole had been made by the impact of the projectile
sample-002613 the caravan began to travel day and night
sample-002614 and it knew nothing about love
sample-002627 this was the strangest of all things that ever came to earth from outer space
sample-002629 that day the merchant gave the boy permission to build the display
sample-002640 we've still got two bucks left
sample-002647 you can count on me under one condition
sample-002653 i thought about whether we should find coins and models in it and so on
sample-002658 all they wanted was food and water
sample-002662 this is christmas eve
sample-002669 then who's this one
sample-002671 but finally the merchant appeared and asked the boy to shear four sheep
sample-002672 it was almost as if her life had been deleted
sample-002673 the nurse waddled around the ward
sample-002676 half an hour later his shovel hit something solid
sample-002677 i heard a faint movement under my feet
sample-002678 sometimes it's better to be with the sheep who don't say anything
sample-002680 it is i the boy answered
sample-002683 i heard a faint movement under my feet
sample-002686 some do come back
sample-002688 something bright reflected from his chest with such intensity that the boy was momentarily blinded
sample-002689 i thought tonight i'd put miss kelly there
sample-002691 but you will love her and she'll return your love
sample-002693 evidently we're the floor show
sample-002694 and i'm afraid we want it back
sample-002696 my wife pointed out to me the brightness of the red green and yellow signal lights
sample-002697 the alchemist knocked on the gate of the monastery
sample-002705 they could barely see the boy
sample-002715 who's gonna get him
sample-002725 now let's see what you look like when you protest
sample-002737 he quickly pulled his hands away
sample-002744 he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so
sample-002745 what had been next to him five minutes ago was now at the other side
sample-002749 he was more certain of it than of anything in the world
sample-002750 three days from now he would be with the merchant's daughter
sample-002758 look where you're going
sample-002760 he moved about invisible but everyone could hear him
sample-002763 you just don't know all that you've done
sample-002765 that night there was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet
sample-002767 to do that successfully i must have no fear of failure
sample-002769 the comparison to other works on different databases is still problematic
sample-002770 they also began to feel that they knew a better way than others had
sample-002779 there's nothing more we can do tonight
sample-002780 that was the law of hospitality
sample-002788 this is a common misconception sheldon said
sample-002796 it's easy for you to talk
sample-002798 the boy put the stones in his pouch
sample-002799 but it is not a class that was requested by our alumni or prospective students
sample-002806 the greatest authority on meteorites stated that the height of its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles
sample-002807 once to the thief and once to the general
sample-002810 you came so that you could learn about your dreams said the old woman
sample-002811 february took a book from the shelves
sample-002813 why don't you want me to see him
sample-002814 it was the time of day when all of spain slept during the summer
sample-002817 speak to the hand that wrote all said the sun
sample-002819 but bakers are more important people than shepherds
sample-002820 have a good trip
sample-002830 the whole town's in an uproar
sample-002832 the references are good in the very narrow area of histogram methods
sample-002838 if you know your heart well it will never be able to do that to you
sample-002841 tell me more about your dream said the woman
sample-002843 i have to separate out the sulfur
sample-002845 just as your grandfather taught you
sample-002854 and don't forget the language of omens
sample-002858 i had the everyone has gary busey's teeth dream again
sample-002865 he said that everything has its own destiny
sample-002869 are you going to go to julia's
sample-002872 the boy went to his room and packed his belongings
sample-002876 he stood irresolute for a moment and then scrambled out of the pit
sample-002886 then he realized that he had been distracted for a few moments looking at the sword
sample-002889 the boy offered his bottle hoping that the old man would leave him alone
sample-002894 if you don't know any alternative search engines just google them
sample-002897 the sun thought for a minute
sample-002899 the desert takes our men from us and they don't always return she said
sample-002900 the boy was trying to understand the truth of what the old man had said
sample-002906 the little group of people from the city dispersed
sample-002909 don't let facebook take up all of your time
sample-002910 what was the reason for the increase
sample-002911 he stood irresolute for a moment and then scrambled out of the pit
sample-002913 and here's fifty dollars on account
sample-002916 turkey for thanksgiving
sample-002917 i wish it were as simple as that
sample-002920 they looked for the fallen mass but found nothing
sample-002922 he put a sign on the door and they went to a small cafe nearby
sample-002924 my review of the sun one star
sample-002933 the boy began to dig into the dune
sample-002934 we speak of them only to children
sample-002942 for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow
sample-002944 finally a young woman approached who was not dressed in black
sample-002946 starting with his own
sample-002947 that sobered him a little
sample-002951 he disappeared into the tent
sample-002955 he sat on a stone and allowed himself to become hypnotized by the horizon
sample-002957 they begin creeping up on you trying to sell you something
sample-002958 but i found it difficult to get to work because of the investigations
sample-002960 we miss you and miss having a friend like you and i am so happy that you two got to catch up
sample-002961 what is love the desert asked
sample-002971 the plastic barrier shattered
sample-002974 your luck's not with you now
sample-002979 it was the most delicious wine he had ever tasted
sample-002980 i shall make us some ice cubes
sample-002988 it would have been visible to me had i only looked up as it passed
sample-002991 men dream more about coming home than about leaving the boy said
sample-002992 show me some gratitude
sample-002993 i read only what the birds wanted to tell me
sample-002994 she placed the glass carefully on the edge of the table
sample-002999 from there he could see africa in the distance
sample-003000 don't be more catholic than the pope
sample-003002 where did everything go
sample-003004 where are you from the boy asked
sample-003005 the alchemist probably already knew all that
sample-003008 going up to see erin
sample-003009 you're probably weak from hunger
sample-003013 aren't you allowed to kiss back
sample-003019 it was however still so hot from its flight through the air
sample-003023 the boy was getting irritated
sample-003026 replace the ts in tim tebow's name with any other consonant to get a star wars character
sample-003029 i have already described the appearance of that colossal bulk which was embedded in the ground
sample-003030 why shouldn't i make father my beneficiary
sample-003031 i can see april coming
sample-003033 at most they thought that another meteorite had descended
sample-003034 your face is really beautiful
sample-003036 there's the city hall tower i'm supposed to visit
sample-003039 how did it start
sample-003042 you'll weaken when you see that little jezebel
sample-003055 heads popping back behind doors
sample-003058 and don't forget the language of omens
sample-003060 as soon as he saw me among the crowd he called to me to come down
sample-003062 the boy didn't want to talk about the pyramids
sample-003063 the boy began to dig into the dune
sample-003066 he couldn't have been wrong
sample-003068 he couldn't have been wrong
sample-003073 there was no response from the elders
sample-003082 let's stop this another commander said
sample-003086 at once he connected the two incidents
sample-003097 i haven't any watch
sample-003102 you don't have to go with me
sample-003103 i am definitely open to the idea because ive always wanted to work as a small business owner
sample-003104 my keychain is heavy and awkward to carry in my pocket
sample-003106 and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction
sample-003107 the wind began to blow again
sample-003108 but the boy never took his eye off his new friend
sample-003111 the old man was probably a gypsy too
sample-003112 watch out for his venom the boy said
sample-003117 the boy took out urim and thummim from his bag
sample-003119 must have been that jump in the cold water
sample-003121 wait till those two future jailbirds read the morning post tomorrow
sample-003125 i thought the unscrewing might be automatic
sample-003127 in general people have difficulties estimating risks correctly
sample-003128 night fell and an assortment of fighting men and merchants entered and exited the tent
sample-003132 the boy noticed that the owner of the bar stood nearby listening attentively to their conversation
sample-003134 but my heart is agitated the boy said
sample-003136 i told you i can't use your column any more
sample-003139 he took back his books and packed them away again in their bags
sample-003141 you forgot to pack it
sample-003143 but my heart is agitated the boy said
sample-003144 do you read me
sample-003146 that's not my money
sample-003156 always ask an objective question
sample-003159 the simum blew that day as it had never blown before
sample-003170 i shall make us some ice cubes
sample-003173 i'd know that voice anywhere
sample-003177 i couldnt stop staring at it
sample-003180 it was dropping off in flakes and raining down on the sand
sample-003182 scattered groups of people were hurrying from the direction of woking
sample-003188 i guess i was homesick
sample-003190 you point to a trail of ants leading into the house
sample-003192 they all complain they're practically working for the government
sample-003193 if only we could see it
sample-003195 i pointed out mars a bright dot of light
sample-003199 that's why i feel that i deserve a part of what you find
sample-003212 that's where you're mistaken
sample-003218 someplace you could have put it
sample-003225 he didn't know the man yet but his practiced eye would recognize him when he appeared
sample-003232 the following night the boy appeared at the alchemist's tent with a horse
sample-003233 he stood silent and motionless regarding me
sample-003234 i'm beginning to realize that
sample-003237 vicky wanted to not make a spectacle of herself
sample-003241 you can hear out of it
sample-003242 she and the judge are like corned beef and cabbage
sample-003246 the young arab took out a book and began to read
sample-003254 i'll talk to you tonight
sample-003258 trust in your heart but never forget that you're in the desert
sample-003259 well then why do we need all these books the boy asked
sample-003261 and look how many things the wind already knew how to do
sample-003269 he prepared himself a sandwich and drank some hot tea from a crystal glass
sample-003274 to stuff into their own pockets
sample-003277 i'll just watch him he said to himself
sample-003278 the englishman was disappointed
sample-003286 he's looking for you
sample-003290 now let's take a look at the candidates
sample-003292 he could always go back to being a shepherd
sample-003299 what time is it
sample-003304 toffee coated all the surfaces it was disgustingly sticky
sample-003305 somebody had returned my lost credit card to the bank
sample-003308 did you see his picture on the cover of time
sample-003309 in one he had read that many years ago a famous arabian alchemist had visited europe
sample-003323 it was only when i got this close to it that the strangeness of it was at all evident to me
sample-003325 for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow
sample-003330 then he dropped his spade picked up his jacket and came out into the road
sample-003335 you can try using an eye tracker to accomplish this but the precision isn't quite high enough
sample-003342 the serpent relaxed immediately
sample-003344 one must prepare for it
sample-003347 why shouldn't i make father my beneficiary
sample-003349 what's she up to
sample-003350 these are the spies said one of the men
sample-003352 as fast as i can
sample-003368 another dreamer said the ticket seller to his assistant watching the boy walk away
sample-003369 the boy was relieved
sample-003377 who could have predicted that
sample-003386 at the first glance it was really not very exciting
sample-003391 why do they need gin
sample-003402 that sobered him a little
sample-003403 fatima appeared at the entrance to the tent
sample-003405 somewhere you are holding the person i love the boy said
sample-003414 put down that chair
sample-003416 she felt like a weakling in comparison to her newborn daughter
sample-003418 all the joy he had seen that morning had suddenly disappeared
sample-003419 who's the ten for
sample-003420 i can't think any more
sample-003428 why don't we search their rooms
sample-003434 the experiments are unconvincing
sample-003436 is it a deal or isn't it
sample-003437 but i found it difficult to get to work because of the investigations
sample-003438 when he speaks in our language i can interpret what he has said
sample-003440 i'll take mine now
sample-003444 i'll see you get it in fifteen minutes
sample-003446 you are wise because you observe everything from a distance the boy said
sample-003451 how do you know she didn't
sample-003453 at that point in their lives everything is clear and everything is possible
sample-003454 you got your sea legs yet
sample-003457 give me the district attorney's office
sample-003458 but i didnt think that it contained any living creature
sample-003462 i just don't trust anyone who says they've never had hamburger helper
sample-003464 tell me more about your dream said the woman
sample-003469 the boy stood up shakily and looked once more at the pyramids
sample-003471 then she filled her vessel with water and left
sample-003477 they had gone away to breakfast at henderson's house
sample-003479 he's on the way
sample-003480 water boarding is a terrible form of torture
sample-003486 it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds
sample-003489 please don't make me
sample-003493 i'll give it a drink
sample-003498 that's too far from the bedroom
sample-003499 and they attacked an empty tent
sample-003500 the boy was surprised and then irritated
sample-003504 i feel quite ambivalent about the article
sample-003505 first they tried to find him on their own
sample-003506 the sun was turned into a golden disk
sample-003509 this is the mayor
sample-003511 you didn't vote for me the last time
sample-003516 i only interpret dreams
sample-003519 better bring me a glass of milk
sample-003520 we showed up and gave minute speeches each
sample-003521 the boy was also saddened his friend was in pursuit of his destiny
sample-003522 its saturday its hot and i really want to try the dry ramen
sample-003525 he got up early with the idea of finding it
sample-003527 he put a sign on the door and they went to a small cafe nearby
sample-003529 i had the everyone has gary busey's teeth dream again
sample-003532 it may be the gases of the firing that caused the martians inconvenience
sample-003534 we beat the whole country on that story
sample-003535 you should see the other guy specifically how good at fighting he is
sample-003540 but that was simply because my eye was tired
sample-003541 it seemed such a little thing so bright and small and still
sample-003551 i'm going to build a bridge a mile long
sample-003553 he asked it please never to stop speaking to him
sample-003555 but then he remembered that he wasn't going to have to pay anything
sample-003556 some storms are worth the wreckage
sample-003562 we dont want him
sample-003563 makes about five thousand a year
sample-003564 one can imagine these two covered with sand running up the little street in the bright sunlight
sample-003565 the burning fire had been extinguished
sample-003572 that first day everyone slept from exhaustion including the englishman
sample-003588 it's called the principle of favorability beginner's luck
sample-003595 i want my husband to wander as free as the wind that shapes the dunes
sample-003601 i'm not afraid of anything
sample-003604 get the governor on the phone
sample-003606 where do you live shouted the boy as the horseman rode away
sample-003609 she's a wonderful person
sample-003611 how do you do
sample-003612 he got up early with the idea of finding it
sample-003615 what's she doing over here
sample-003623 your mother and i talked it over half the night
sample-003633 i'm a sucker for it
sample-003634 why can't you be serious
sample-003649 some do come back
sample-003650 lots of shepherds passed through selling their wool
sample-003652 suddenly he disappeared and i could hear a faint shriek behind the walls
sample-003654 my review of the sun one star
sample-003664 i'll tell you in a minute
sample-003665 i have the diet of a kid who found twenty dollars
sample-003667 the fact that the two hours had stretched into an entire year didn't matter
sample-003670 aren't we godlike
sample-003680 and then he perceived it very slowly
sample-003682 they mounted their horses
sample-003685 i'll cover the method i use and describe some alternatives
sample-003691 the charcoal burned away to white ash
sample-003692 he stood irresolute for a moment and then scrambled out of the pit
sample-003693 you can't see the planet with the naked eye
sample-003698 many people in berkshire surrey and middlesex must have seen it
sample-003703 frank was dying so they were forced to leave him
sample-003711 so he began to wander through the city and found himself at the gates
sample-003718 he could always go back to being a shepherd
sample-003721 he knew he was stronger than his friend
sample-003725 absolutely despicable that gingerbread men are forced to live in houses made of their own flesh
sample-003727 this was the strangest of all things that ever came to earth from outer space
sample-003728 her walls were covered with dark and scary sketches
sample-003729 here i am between my flock and my treasure the boy thought
sample-003732 i'm afraid it'll be steve tina
sample-003733 don't give in to your fears said the alchemist in a strangely gentle voice
sample-003735 it was seen early in the morning rushing over eastward
sample-003739 did you see the garden that it took the master gardener ten years to create
sample-003740 he didn't seduce her with his words but with subliminal messages that's the trick
sample-003742 i'm coming fatima he said
sample-003747 the boy looked around for the ovens and other apparatus used in alchemy but saw none
sample-003748 suppose there was a shane york and he walked into this office
sample-003751 i haven't won my wings yet
sample-003752 i think you're a great guy
sample-003755 and above all don't forget to follow your destiny through to its conclusion
sample-003756 had our instruments permitted it we might have been able to see the trouble way back when
sample-003764 so you know about love the boy said
sample-003770 but bakers are more important people than shepherds
sample-003778 we'll leave tomorrow before sunrise was the alchemist's only response
sample-003781 but horses tire bit by bit
sample-003782 they began to ride out over the sands with the moon lighting their way
sample-003783 just one more try
sample-003789 i almost dropped him
sample-003790 the accommodation was affordable and cosy
sample-003792 the river babbled inanely to itself
sample-003793 the airplane rose gracefully into the sky
sample-003795 the level ground was blackened as far as one could see and it was still giving off smoke
sample-003796 but would you mind telling me who goes out
sample-003799 get a load of this
sample-003802 wouldn't do any good
sample-003803 i thought sure you'd remember me
sample-003804 he decanted the wine and began to recount the disturbing story he had been told
sample-003808 i had to test your courage the stranger said
sample-003814 everyone has his or her own way of learning things he said to himself
sample-003816 hang on for a second
sample-003819 hey what do you say
sample-003825 the pink love heart keyring glowed
sample-003828 somebody's going to get hurt
sample-003831 at the first glance it was really not very exciting
sample-003832 something happens here you'll have to remember later on
sample-003833 and if it is
sample-003836 the chair had leather upholstery
sample-003852 the newspaper articles had prepared everyone for the reception of the idea
sample-003853 i forgot my hat
sample-003855 no one seemed to have thought about it that night
sample-003863 you should have seen the commotion in that locker room
sample-003866 coach has heard all about you
sample-003873 the boy looked around for the ovens and other apparatus used in alchemy but saw none
sample-003876 it may be the gases of the firing that caused the martians inconvenience
sample-003881 and then he perceived it very slowly
sample-003887 i was expecting you
sample-003888 they mounted their horses
sample-003890 what's the matter with you two guys
sample-003898 thank you very much
sample-003899 you'll ask me to what
sample-003905 we don't have to give up our club
sample-003907 he must be disguised to avoid encounters with thieves
sample-003920 i'm looking for a treasure said the boy and he immediately regretted having said it
sample-003923 they set off running wildly into the trees
sample-003925 other servants maintained the fires in the hookahs
sample-003928 next you'll want to enumerate tabs so you can quickly jump between them
sample-003933 he restarted his efforts for the twentieth time
sample-003937 but the marketplace was empty and he was far from home so he wept
sample-003939 and don't forget the language of omens
sample-003940 most meteorites are more or less rounded
sample-003941 i wonder what's eating that old money grubbing buzzard anyway
sample-003945 asymmetric cryptography uses pairs of keys
sample-003948 you'd think i was on the witness stand
sample-003949 with a bag of marshmallows
sample-003952 the teller didn't have enough change
sample-003955 it's not i the wind spoke about
sample-003959 but then i realized she couldn't have been
sample-003962 the boy reminded the old man that he had said something about hidden treasure
sample-003968 he wanted to forget about the vision and return to his meditation
sample-003971 i'll return just as your father came back to your mother he said
sample-003975 it had a diameter of about thirty yards
sample-003979 he wasn't asking for help
sample-003987 that guy over there likes to drink a lot talk a lot but do nothing
sample-003991 it seems old and wise
sample-004003 they set off running wildly into the trees
sample-004005 they formed heaps that are visible a mile and a half away
sample-004009 although searching in binary search trees is efficient you won't find any fruits in there
sample-004014 they were known as seers and they were held in fear by women and the elderly
sample-004015 trying to improve the world by jumping up and down
sample-004016 mr lee can't be bothered now
sample-004017 it must have fallen while i was sitting over there
sample-004023 you want the moon
sample-004028 the one in there
sample-004031 where did he keep his money
sample-004033 as he looked at the stones he felt relieved for some reason
sample-004036 three cheers for aden christopher
sample-004039 are you enjoying london
sample-004040 they placed the symbols of the pilgrimage on the doors of their houses
sample-004044 as the sun rose the men began to beat the boy
sample-004045 i have to find a man who knows that universal language
sample-004048 did you ever walk into this office
sample-004051 everything looked diffuse after she took the narcotic
sample-004055 the atmosphere was suffused with the sweet scent of smoke
sample-004067 they reached the center of a large plaza where the market was held
sample-004069 no sense messing up the streets
sample-004073 that's what i'm not supposed to say
